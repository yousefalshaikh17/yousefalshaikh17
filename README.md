## About Me

Hi, I'm Yousef!

I'm a passionate software developer with a background in full-stack development and a strong focus on backend systems. I also have a solid background in game development, which has fueled my creativity and technical problem-solving skills. I recently earned my Master's in Computer Science and have been developing software for many years, constantly expanding my skills through personal projects and research.

My journey into programming started when I was ten, building websites out of curiosity. That early passion grew into a deep interest in creating scalable systems, optimizing performance, and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I eventually explored game development, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with artists, combining my love for coding with bringing creative ideas to life through immersive user experiences.
