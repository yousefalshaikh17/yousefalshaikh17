# Welcome

Hi, I'm Yousef! Welcome to my Github profile! ☺️

# About Me

I'm a passionate software developer with a background in full-stack development and a strong focus on backend systems. I also have a solid background in game development, which has fueled my creativity and technical problem-solving skills. I recently earned my Master's in Advanced Computer Science from the University of Leeds and have been developing software for many years, constantly expanding my skills through personal projects and research.

My journey into programming started when I was ten, building websites out of curiosity. That early passion grew into a deep interest in creating scalable systems, optimizing performance, and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. I eventually explored game development, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with artists, combining my love for coding with bringing creative ideas to life through immersive user experiences.


# Project Highlights
